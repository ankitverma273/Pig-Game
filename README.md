# Pig-Game
This is a normal dice rolling game, made for 2 players.
just roll the dice and whicever player reche to a score of 100 first will win.
A twist for players, where if 1 comes when the dice is rolledthe current score will</br>
then be reseted to 0 for the active player, and the player will be switched to 2nd player</br>
but if you hold the score, your current score will be added to your total score and again the player is switched.
